# LMS
An e-learning platform with focus on scalability, modularity and openness.

LearningMadeSimple was an internship project at OddHill http://www.oddhill.se/
The platform was built with the use of the framework AngularJS for the client side and NodeJS for the server side.

We used Digitalocean to host the application during the development and now moved it to Heroku for demo purposes.

API documentation can be found here:
